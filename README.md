This repo is mainly used to improve my python skills while using netbox and netmiko. 

- Netbox is used to be the surce of truth - setting a class with methods to update or get information from the instance , Netbox can be instancated to call each method such as get_devices 

- Netmiko is used to connect to remote devices as it handles the connection setup and command sent.
